Current social trends coupled with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic have left people feeling isolated and alone.

  * Due to the pandemic fewer people are visiting small businesses, tourist attractions, and entertainment related venues. 
  * A significant amount of the population have very busy schedules making organising an outing an unnecessary hassle.
  * Having to manually take into consideration all of one's friendsâ€™ interests when planning an outing is cumbersome and sometimes frustrating.
  * Having to meticulously organise an outing can make the outing itself less enjoyable and dissuade people from going out in the first place.



To address these problems, we propose creating PlusOne, an application that automatically develops a fun and exciting recreational agenda for users based on their preferences to make going out with friends and family a simple, enjoyable and exciting experience.
